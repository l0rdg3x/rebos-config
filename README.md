# Rebos Configuration

This config is structured weirdly. This is so I can store all my distro configs in one repo.

Please note that this is my own personal configuration, so I recommend forking it.
I am not accepting pull requests unless it is to improve my configuration.

Assuming you cloned the repo as `~/.config/rebos-cfgs`,
here is how you choose a config: `$ ln -s $HOME/.config/rebos-cfgs/configs/<insert OS name> $HOME/.config/rebos`

Assuming you cloned the repo as `~/.config/rebos-cfgs`,
you can also run the choosing script: `~/.config/rebos-cfgs/choose-config.sh` (RECOMMENDED METHOD)
